## Why This Exists

Most learning happens in fragments — a tutorial here, a blog post there, a half-finished course somewhere. This repository is an attempt to solve that by providing a **single, organized, extensible workspace** where learning resources, hands-on experimentation, and AI-powered guidance live together.

It started as a way to learn GitHub Copilot's customization features, but evolved into something broader: a **general-purpose learning assistant** that covers software engineering deeply while remaining open to any subject — professional growth, daily productivity, career planning, or pure curiosity.

### Who Is This For?

- **Developers** who want a structured way to learn CS/SE concepts with curated resources
- **Students** preparing for technical interviews (DSA, system design, behavioral)
- **Engineers** exploring industry practices from Netflix, Google, Uber, Spotify, and others
- **Anyone** interested in building their own AI-assisted learning environment
- **Copilot users** who want to see what's possible with agents, prompts, and skills

---

## What You Get

### A Curated Knowledge Base (2,400+ lines)

Hand-curated, continuously expanded reference material covering:

| Area | Depth |
|---|---|
| **Data Structures & Algorithms** | Complexity tables, pattern taxonomy, interview prep, industry use cases |
| **System Design** | HLD/LLD deep dives, estimation cheat sheets, 10+ case studies |
| **DevOps & CI/CD** | Pipeline anatomy, deployment strategies, Docker/K8s, GitOps, feature flags |
| **Build Tools & Git** | Maven/Gradle deep dives, 60+ Git commands, branching strategies, internals |
| **Industry Patterns** | Rate limiting, circuit breakers, event-driven architecture, microservices |
| **Real-World Engineering** | How Netflix, Google, Uber, and Spotify build systems at scale |
| **Tech Trends (2025–26)** | AI coding assistants, agentic AI, platform engineering, Wasm, Rust, eBPF |
| **Full SDLC** | 8-phase lifecycle, testing pyramid, frontend/backend/DB aspects |
| **Security** | OWASP Top 10, zero trust, supply chain security, secrets management |
| **Career** | 10+ tech roles, skills matrices, salary data, transition roadmaps |

> This isn't just a link dump — it's structured reference material with explanations, comparison tables, ASCII diagrams, and real code examples.

### An AI-Powered Learning Environment

If you use **VS Code + GitHub Copilot**, the repo transforms Chat into a personalized tutor:

- **30 slash commands** — type `/dsa`, `/system-design`, `/devops`, `/learn-concept`, `/mcp`, or `/hub` to navigate
- **7 specialist agents** — Learning Mentor, Designer, Debugger, Impact Analyzer, Code Reviewer, Daily Assistant, and a deep-research "Thinking Beast Mode"
- **8 auto-loaded skill packs** — Copilot automatically gains domain knowledge when you ask relevant questions

> **No Copilot? No problem.** The knowledge base, book recommendations, and learning paths are valuable as standalone reference material — the `.github/skills/` folder is a readable, well-organized Markdown knowledge base.

### A Code Sandbox

The `src/` directory is your playground. Use it to:
- Implement algorithms after learning them
- Prototype system designs
- Experiment with new language features (Java 21+: records, sealed classes, virtual threads)
- Try design patterns from the skill packs
- Add code in any language — Java, Python, Go, Rust, whatever you're learning

---

## Quick Start

### Option 1: With GitHub Copilot (Full Experience)

**Prerequisites:** VS Code + GitHub Copilot extension + Java 21+ (optional)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/learning-assistant.git
cd learning-assistant
code .
```

1. Open VS Code Chat (`Ctrl+Shift+I`)
2. Type `/hub` → browse all available commands
3. Try `/learn-concept` → type any topic → get a structured lesson
4. Try `/dsa` → pick a data structure → learn with code + complexity analysis
5. Try `/system-design` → design a URL shortener, rate limiter, or chat system

For a guided walkthrough, see the [Getting Started Tutorial](.github/docs/getting-started.md) (~30 min).

### Option 2: Without Copilot (Knowledge Base Only)

Browse the skill files directly — they're well-structured Markdown:

- [Software Engineering Resources](.github/skills/software-engineering-resources/SKILL.md) — the main 2,400+ line knowledge base
- [Java Learning Resources](.github/skills/java-learning-resources/SKILL.md) — Java-specific tutorials, docs, projects
- [Career Resources](.github/skills/career-resources/SKILL.md) — roles, skills, compensation, roadmaps
- [Design Patterns](.github/skills/design-patterns/SKILL.md) — GoF patterns, SOLID, decision guide

## MCP Servers Module

The `mcp-servers/` directory contains a **Java-based configuration system** and **MCP server implementations** for the Model Context Protocol — the protocol that lets AI assistants connect to external tools and data sources.

### Learning Resources Server (NEW)

The first built-in MCP server — a **web scraper + curated resource vault** with 47+ hand-picked learning resources:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_resources` | Search the vault by text, category, type, or difficulty |
| `browse_vault` | Browse all resources grouped by category or type |
| `get_resource` | Get full details for a specific resource |
| `list_categories` | List all available resource categories |
| `discover_resources` | Smart 3-mode discovery (specific/vague/exploratory) |
| `scrape_url` | Scrape any URL and get a content summary |
| `read_url` | Scrape any URL and get full readable content |
| `add_resource` | Add a new resource to the vault |
| `add_resource_from_url` | Scrape URL → auto-extract metadata → add to vault |
| `export_results` | Export results as Markdown, PDF, or Word |

```bash
# Try it:
cd mcp-servers
javac -d out src/**/*.java
java -cp out server.learningresources.LearningResourcesServer --demo
java -cp out server.learningresources.LearningResourcesServer --list-tools
```

See [Learning Resources Server README](mcp-servers/src/server/learningresources/README.md) for full documentation.

### Configuration System

**What it manages:**
- API keys and secrets (GitHub, OpenAI, Slack, databases)
- Location preferences (timezone, locale, cloud region)
- User preferences (theme, log level, retries, timeouts)
- Browser isolation (dedicated profile to prevent MCP servers from hijacking personal tabs)
- Server definitions (stdio, SSE, streamable-http transports)
- Named profiles (development, production, testing) with config merging
- Environment variable overrides (`MCP_*` prefix)

**Quick start:**
```bash
cp mcp-servers/user-config/mcp-config.example.properties mcp-servers/user-config/mcp-config.properties
# Replace <<<PLACEHOLDER>>> values (search for "<<<")
```

See the [MCP Servers README](mcp-servers/README.md) for the full setup guide, architecture docs, and how to add new servers.

## How the AI Features Work

The `.github/` directory uses GitHub Copilot's 5 customization primitives:

| Primitive | What It Does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Instructions** (`.instructions.md`) | Auto-applied coding rules per file type | Java naming conventions load when editing `.java` |
| **Agents** (`.agent.md`) | Specialist personas you select from a dropdown | "Learning Mentor" teaches with analogies and exercises |
| **Prompts** (`.prompt.md`) | Slash commands that run pre-built workflows | `/dsa → binary search → python` produces a full lesson |
| **Skills** (`SKILL.md`) | Knowledge packs auto-loaded by topic match | Ask about "rate limiting" → industry patterns load automatically |
| **Project Instructions** (`copilot-instructions.md`) | Always-on project rules | Naming conventions, method size limits, Javadoc requirements |

For the full architecture, see the [Customization Guide](.github/docs/customization-guide.md).
