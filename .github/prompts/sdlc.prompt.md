### Methodology Comparison
```

Waterfall:    Requirements ──→ Design ──→ Build ──→ Test ──→ Deploy (linear)
Agile/Scrum:  Sprint[Plan → Dev → Test → Review → Retro] × N (iterative)
Kanban:       Continuous flow with WIP limits (pull-based)
XP:           Short iterations + pair programming + TDD + CI (discipline)
Spiral:       Plan → Risk Analysis → Engineer → Evaluate (risk-driven)
SAFe:         Scaled Agile for large organizations (frameworks of frameworks)

```

### Response by Focus

#### If focus = learn-phase:
1. **Phase overview** — What happens here and why
2. **Inputs & outputs** — What enters this phase, what it produces
3. **Key activities** — Step-by-step within the phase
4. **Roles involved** — Who does what (developer, QA, PM, etc.)
5. **Tools commonly used** — Jira, GitHub, Jenkins, etc.
6. **Common mistakes** — What goes wrong in this phase
7. **Best practices** — How to do it well
8. **How it connects** — Upstream and downstream dependencies

#### If focus = learn-methodology:
1. **Core philosophy** — What drives this approach
2. **Ceremonies/events** — Meetings, rituals, cadence
3. **Roles** — Who has what responsibility
4. **Artifacts** — What documents/boards are produced
5. **Advantages vs disadvantages** — Honest trade-offs
6. **When to use** — Team size, project type, organization culture
7. **When NOT to use** — Situations where it fails
8. **Transition tips** — How to adopt if coming from another methodology

#### If focus = compare-approaches:
Comparison table + concrete recommendation based on team context.

### Rules
- Be practical — connect every concept to real team workflows
- Include specific tool examples (Jira, GitHub, Jenkins, etc.) but explain the concept first
- For testing topics, always show real code examples of the testing approach
- For methodology topics, include real sprint/board examples where relevant
- Acknowledge that most teams use hybrid approaches — pure methodology is rare
