| **gRPC** | RPC | Multiplexed (HTTP/2) | Microservice-to-microservice, low latency | Protobuf (binary) |
| **GraphQL** | Query language | Stateless | Flexible client-driven queries | JSON |
| **WebSocket** | Bidirectional | Stateful | Real-time: chat, gaming, live feeds | Any |

## How to Use This Skill

When a learner asks about **any** software engineering concept:
1. **Identify the domain** — is it DSA, system design, networking, OS, testing, patterns, etc.?
2. **Recommend the best resource** from the relevant section above
3. **Provide the canonical book reference** if one exists
4. **Point to hands-on practice** — exercises, projects, or code to study
5. **Use `fetch` to retrieve content** from official documentation websites when the learner wants to study specific pages

When recommending resources:
- Start with **1 official doc + 1 tutorial + 1 hands-on** — never overwhelm with 10 links
- Explain **why** each resource is recommended for the learner's current level
- Sequence resources: foundational → practical → advanced
