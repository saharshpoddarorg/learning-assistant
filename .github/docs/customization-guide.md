## 🌍 The Big Picture

GitHub Copilot customization is a **layered system** that progressively shapes Copilot's behavior:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  YOUR QUESTION                  │
│          "Review Main.java for SOLID"           │

                     ▼

│  1. Load copilot-instructions.md    (always)    │
│  2. Load matching *.instructions.md (by file)   │
│  3. Load active agent persona       (if set)    │
│  4. Load matching skills            (by topic)  │
│  5. Execute prompt template         (if /cmd)   │
│                                                 │
│         Everything merges → AI responds         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key insight:** These aren't separate features — they **stack together**. When you ask the Designer agent to review `Main.java` using `/design-review`, Copilot combines:

- Project-wide rules from `copilot-instructions.md`
- Java-specific rules from `java.instructions.md` + `clean-code.instructions.md`
- Designer agent's persona and expertise
- Design-patterns skill (if the topic matches)
- The review structure from `design-review.prompt.md`

---

## 🔗 How the Primitives Work Together

### 1. Instructions — The Rules

```
copilot-instructions.md          ← Base layer (always on)
     +
java.instructions.md             ← When editing *.java
     +
clean-code.instructions.md       ← When editing *.java (stacks!)
     =
Combined coding standards        ← What Copilot follows
```

**Role:** Define *how* code should be written — naming, structure, patterns, style.
**Activation:** Automatic, based on the file being edited.
**Docs:** [Instructions Guide](../instructions/README.md)

### 2. Agents — The Specialists

```
Default (Ask)  ← General-purpose Copilot
Designer       ← Thinks in patterns, SOLID, architecture
Debugger       ← Thinks in hypotheses, root causes, evidence
Impact Analyzer← Thinks in ripple effects, dependencies, risk
Learning Mentor← Thinks in analogies, exercises, progression
```

**Role:** Define *who* Copilot becomes — the persona, expertise, and approach.
**Activation:** Manual — you select from the dropdown in Chat.
**Docs:** [Agents Guide](../agents/README.md)

### 3. Prompts — The Shortcuts

```
/design-review  → Runs design review workflow with Designer agent
/debug          → Runs debugging workflow with Debugger agent
/teach          → Runs teaching workflow with Learning Mentor agent
/impact         → Runs impact analysis with Impact Analyzer agent
/refactor       → Runs refactoring suggestions with Designer agent
/explain        → Runs file explanation with default Ask agent
/composite      → Combines multiple modes into a unified analysis
/context        → Continues prior conversation or starts fresh
/scope          → Sets generic-learning vs code-specific scope
/learn-from-docs→ Learn concepts via official documentation
/explore-project→ Learn by studying open-source projects
/deep-dive      → Multi-layered progressive concept exploration
/reading-plan   → Structured reading/learning plan with resources
/learn-concept  → Learn any CS/SE concept (language-agnostic)
/interview-prep → DSA patterns, system design, interview strategies
/hub          → Master navigation index — browse all commands
/dsa          → Data structures & algorithms with pattern hierarchy
/system-design→ Unified HLD/LLD with full internal hierarchy
/devops       → CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, cloud, IaC, monitoring
/language-guide→ Language-specific learning framework
/tech-stack   → Frameworks, libraries, databases — compare & learn
/sdlc         → SDLC phases, methodologies, engineering practices
/mcp          → MCP server architecture, building servers, agent patterns
/daily-assist → Finance, productivity, news, daily life tasks
/career-roles → Job roles, skills, pay, career roadmaps
/multi-session → Manage state across multiple chat sessions
/brain-new    → Create knowledge notes (inbox/notes tier)
/brain-publish → Publish an imported source to library/ and commit
/brain-search → Search notes by tag, project, kind, date, or text
```

**Role:** Define *what* to do — pre-built workflows you trigger with a command.
**Activation:** Manual — type `/command` in Chat.
**Docs:** [Prompts Guide](../prompts/README.md)

> 💡 **Meta-prompts** (`/composite`, `/context`, `/scope`) are special — they control *how* Copilot works rather than *what* it works on. They can be combined with each other and with task prompts for powerful workflows. See [Meta-Prompts](../prompts/README.md#-meta-prompts-composite-context--scope) for details.

### 4. Skills — The Toolkits

```
java-build/                ← Activates for: compile, build, run
design-patterns/           ← Activates for: Pattern decisions, SOLID
java-debugging/            ← Activates for: Exceptions, stack traces
java-learning-resources/   ← Activates for: Java learning, tutorials, docs
software-engineering-resources/ ← Activates for: DSA, system design, OS, networking, DBMS, testing, DevOps, build tools, Git, security, industry concepts, tech trends
daily-assistant-resources/  ← Activates for: Finance, productivity, news, daily planning
career-resources/           ← Activates for: Job roles, salaries, career paths, skills
mcp-development/            ← Activates for: MCP servers, protocol, tools, agent architecture, building MCP
```

**Role:** Provide *extra knowledge* — scripts, templates, domain expertise.
**Activation:** Automatic — Copilot matches your question to skill descriptions.
**Docs:** [Skills Guide](../skills/README.md)

## 📊 Priority & Stacking Order

When multiple customizations apply, Copilot merges them. Highest priority wins on conflicts:

| Priority | Source | Loaded When |
|---|---|---|
| **1 (highest)** | **Your message** | What you type always overrides everything |
| 2 | Prompt template | `/command` invoked |
| 3 | Active agent persona | Agent selected in dropdown |
| 4 | Matching skills | Topic matches skill description |
| 5 | Path-specific instructions | File matches `applyTo` glob |
| 6 (lowest) | `copilot-instructions.md` | Always loaded |

> ⚠️ **Conflicts:** If an agent says "use Strategy pattern" but instructions say "avoid complex patterns," the agent's guidance typically wins (higher priority). Design your customizations to complement, not contradict.
>
> This table matches the [Priority Order](../README.md#priority-order) in the main README.

### Handoff Flow Between Agents

Agents can **hand off** to each other for multi-step workflows:

```
Designer ──handoff──▶ Impact Analyzer ──handoff──▶ Code Reviewer
   │                       │                           │
   │ "Here's my            │ "Here's what              │ "Here's the
   │  design review"       │  changes would            │  code quality
   │                       │  affect"                  │  assessment"
   ▼                       ▼                           ▼
Design                 Ripple-effect              Code quality
recommendations        analysis                   feedback

Learning-Mentor ──handoff──▶ Agent (practice) ──handoff──▶ Code-Reviewer (verify)

Daily-Assistant ──handoff──▶ Learning-Mentor (learn deeper)
                                │
                                └──▶ Agent (implement)

Thinking-Beast-Mode: Autonomous (no handoffs — fully self-contained deep research)

## 🔧 How to Extend the System

### Adding a New Agent

<details>
<summary><strong>Template</strong></summary>

Create `.github/agents/<name>.agent.md`:

```markdown
---
description: One-line summary of what this agent specializes in
tools:
  - search
  - codebase
  - usages
handoffs:
  - agent-name-1
  - agent-name-2
---

You are a [ROLE]. Your expertise is [DOMAIN].

When the user asks you to [TASK]:

1. First, [STEP 1]
2. Then, [STEP 2]
3. Finally, [STEP 3]

## Rules
- Always [RULE 1]
- Never [RULE 2]
- Prefer [PREFERENCE]
```

</details>

### Adding a New Skill

<details>
<summary><strong>Template</strong></summary>

1. Create folder: `.github/skills/<skill-name>/`
2. Create `.github/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: >
  Specific description of what this skill provides.
  Use when asked to [ACTION 1], [ACTION 2], or [ACTION 3].
---

# Skill Name

## Quick Reference
- Key fact 1
- Key fact 2

## Detailed Instructions
...
```

3. *(Optional)* Add resource files alongside SKILL.md

</details>

### Adding a New Prompt

<details>
<summary><strong>Template</strong></summary>

Create `.github/prompts/<name>.prompt.md`:

```markdown
---
agent: agent-name
description: What this prompt does (shown in autocomplete)
---

Your task: [CLEAR INSTRUCTION]

Steps:
1. [STEP 1]
2. [STEP 2]
3. [STEP 3]

Format your response as:
## Section 1
...
## Section 2
...
```

</details>

### Adding a New Instruction

<details>
<summary><strong>Template</strong></summary>

Create `.github/instructions/<name>.instructions.md`:

```markdown
---
applyTo: "glob/pattern/**/*.ext"
---

# Category Name

- Rule 1: Be specific and actionable
- Rule 2: Include concrete examples
- Rule 3: Keep it concise (10-20 rules max)
```

</details>

---

## 🔍 File Audience — Copilot vs Developer

A common point of confusion: not every file in `.github/` is read by Copilot. Understanding the distinction is critical when extending the system.

### 🤖 Files Copilot Reads (affect AI behavior)

These files are **loaded into the AI context** and directly shape how Copilot responds:

| Type | Extension/Name | When Loaded | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Project instructions | `copilot-instructions.md` | Every request | Project-wide rules |
| Path-scoped instructions | `*.instructions.md` | When `applyTo` glob matches | File-type-specific rules |
| Agents | `*.agent.md` | When selected in dropdown | Persona, expertise, tools |
| Prompts | `*.prompt.md` | When `/command` invoked | Task workflow template |
| Skills | `SKILL.md` | When question matches description | Extra knowledge & tools |

**How to write them:**
- Write as **directives to an AI**: "Use X", "Never do Y", "When asked to Z..."
- Keep focused — shorter instructions get better compliance
- YAML frontmatter controls activation (`applyTo`, `tools`, `description`, etc.)
- Changes take effect **immediately** on the next Copilot interaction

### 👤 Files for Developers (documentation only)

These files are **never loaded by Copilot**. They exist as reference material for you:

| File | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | Every subfolder | Guide explaining that folder's primitive |
| `getting-started.md` | `docs/` | Hands-on tutorial |
| `customization-guide.md` | `docs/` | Architecture deep-dive (this file) |
| `file-reference.md` | `docs/` | Complete breakdown of who reads what |
| `slash-commands.md` | `docs/` | All 36 slash commands: aliases, inputs, composition |

**How to write them:**
- Write as **explanation for humans**: clear prose, examples, links
- Editing these does NOT change Copilot's behavior
- Keep them in sync — update when you add new agents/prompts/skills

### Quick Test: "Is this file for Copilot?"

| Clue | Audience |
|---|---|
| Has `applyTo:`, `tools:`, `handoffs:`, or `description:` in YAML frontmatter | 🤖 Copilot |
| Extension is `.instructions.md`, `.agent.md`, `.prompt.md` | 🤖 Copilot |
| Named `SKILL.md` (uppercase) | 🤖 Copilot |
| Named `README.md` | 👤 Developer |
| Lives in `docs/` folder | 👤 Developer |
| Contains "Table of Contents", "Experiments to Try" | 👤 Developer |

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### Design Principles

1. **Complement, don't contradict** — agents and instructions should reinforce each other
2. **Keep instructions short** — 10-20 bullet points per instruction file
3. **Keep agent personas focused** — one specialty per agent
4. **Use handoffs** — let agents collaborate instead of making one agent do everything
5. **Include action verbs in skill descriptions** — compile, build, run, debug, test

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Giant instruction files | Rules get diluted | Split into focused files with narrow `applyTo` |
| Agent does everything | Persona is unfocused | One specialty per agent, use handoffs |
| Vague skill descriptions | Skill never loads | Include specific keywords and "Use when..." |
| Duplicate rules | Conflicting behavior | Put shared rules in `copilot-instructions.md` |
| Too many prompts | Hard to remember | Keep to 5-8 core workflows |

### Performance

- **Instructions:** Very cheap — plain text, small context cost
- **Agents:** Medium — persona adds to context but worth it
- **Skills:** Cheap at rest (only name+description), medium when loaded
- **Prompts:** Cheap — just a template
