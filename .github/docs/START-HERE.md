## ❓ What IS This Repo?

A **super-powered developer workspace** with two independent feature sets you can use together or separately:

| Feature Set | What It Does | Where It Lives |
|---|---|---|
| **Copilot Customization** | Teaches GitHub Copilot your coding rules, gives it specialist personas, and adds 30 slash commands | `.github/` |
| **MCP Servers** | Connects Copilot to real tools — search Jira, browse learning docs, read GitHub repos, scrape web pages | `mcp-servers/` |

Both work in **this repo** AND can be **copied to any other project** you work on.

### 🟢 NEWBIE — "I'm new to Copilot, MCP, AI tools... all of this"

You don't know what MCP is, haven't customized Copilot before, and just want things to work.

**Your reading order (do these in sequence):**

| Step | Read This | Time | What You'll Get |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **This page** (you're here) | 2 min | Know where to go |
| 2 | [Phase Guide — Read Me First §§ Phase 0–2](phase-guide.md#phase-0) | 10 min | Understand the whole system |
| 3 | [MCP Server Setup — Complete Guide](mcp-server-setup.md) | 10 min | Get MCP servers working |
| 4 | [Getting Started Tutorial](getting-started.md) | 30 min | Try Copilot customization hands-on |
| 5 | [Phase Guide — Phases 3–7](phase-guide.md#phase-3) | 20 min | Brain workspace + export to other projects |

**After reading, your first 5 actions:**
1. `Ctrl+Shift+B` → **"mcp-servers: build"** — compiles the Java servers
2. Open [`.vscode/mcp.json`](../../.vscode/mcp.json) → change `"disabled": true` to `"disabled": false` for `learning-resources`  
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Reload Window"
4. Open Copilot Chat (`Ctrl+Alt+I`) → switch to **Agent** mode
5. Type `/hub` → see all 30 slash commands

---

### 🟡 AMATEUR — "I know VS Code and GitHub but haven't used MCP or Copilot customization"

You understand terminal commands, git, and file structures. You just haven't set up MCP or customized Copilot before.

**Your reading order:**

| Step | Read This | Time | Skip if... |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Phase Guide — Phases 1–3](phase-guide.md#phase-1) | 15 min | Skip Phase 0 (basics) |
| 2 | [MCP Server Setup §§5–7](mcp-server-setup.md#5-configure-credentials-secrets) | 10 min | You've done MCP before |
| 3 | [Customization Guide](customization-guide.md) | 20 min | You understand the 5 primitives |
| 4 | [Export Guide](export-guide.md) | 15 min | You only use this one repo |

**Jump straight to something specific:**
- Copy to another project → [Export Guide](export-guide.md)
- What all 30 commands do → [Slash Commands](slash-commands.md)
- MCP credentials setup → [MCP Server Setup §5](mcp-server-setup.md#5-configure-credentials-secrets)
- How to not lose work when pressing Enter → [Copilot Workflow Tips §Queue](copilot-workflow.md#queuing-multiple-instructions)

    └── archive/                ← Published, tagged reference
```

**The magic flow:**
```
You ask Copilot a question
    → Copilot reads .github/ (instructions + agent persona + skill)  
    → Copilot optionally calls MCP tools (search Jira, browse docs, read files)
    → Copilot answers with full context of your project AND external data
```
