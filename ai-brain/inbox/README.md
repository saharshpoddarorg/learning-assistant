# ai-brain/inbox/ -- Quick Capture

**Gitignored. Disposable. For this session only.**

Drop anything here immediately -- raw thoughts, intermediate reasoning,
incomplete drafts, anything you are not sure is worth keeping.

Nothing here is committed or pushed. Clear it freely when the session ends.

---

## Typical content

- Mid-session reasoning logs from Copilot or MCP servers
- Partial drafts you are still iterating on
- Exploratory notes: "Let me think through this..."
- Context captured during a task that may not need to persist

---

## Creating notes here

```powershell
# Interactive -- asks for title, kind, tags
.\ai-brain\scripts\brain.ps1 new

# Non-interactive
.\ai-brain\scripts\brain.ps1 new --tier inbox --project mcp-servers --title "SSE transport notes"
```

```bash
./ai-brain/scripts/brain.sh new
./ai-brain/scripts/brain.sh new --tier inbox --project java --title "Generics questions"
```

---

## At the end of a session

```powershell
# See what is here
.\ai-brain\scripts\brain.ps1 status
.\ai-brain\scripts\brain.ps1 list --tier inbox

# Worth keeping? Move to notes/
.\ai-brain\scripts\brain.ps1 move ai-brain\inbox\file.md --tier notes

# Worth committing? Publish directly to repo
.\ai-brain\scripts\brain.ps1 publish ai-brain\inbox\file.md --project mcp-servers

# Done with it? Clear
.\ai-brain\scripts\brain.ps1 clear           # preview
.\ai-brain\scripts\brain.ps1 clear --force   # delete
```
